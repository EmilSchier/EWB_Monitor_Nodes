  This example shows how to set alarm interrupts at RV-3028-C7 Real Time Clock.
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud

int sec = 45;

int hour = 19;
int day = 5;

int year = 2019;

//The below variables control what the alarm will be set to
int alm_minute = 0;
int alm_hour = 20;
int alm_date_or_weekday = 2;

/*********************************
  Set the alarm mode in the following way:
  0: When minutes, hours and weekday/date match (once per weekday/date)
  1: When hours and weekday/date match (once per weekday/date)
  2: When minutes and weekday/date match (once per hour per weekday/date)
  3: When weekday/date match (once per weekday/date)
  4: When hours and minutes match (once per day)
  5: When hours match (once per day)
  6: When minutes match (once per hour)
  7: All disabled â€“ Default value
  If you want to set a weekday alarm (alm_isweekday = true), set 'alm_date_or_weekday' from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday)
